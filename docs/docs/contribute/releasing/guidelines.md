## Release Notes Guidelines

Release notes are automatically generated from pull request titles and authors. Follow these guidelines:

1. PR titles should be descriptive format:

   - `feat: add new feature`
   - `fix: resolve bug`
   - `docs: update documentation`
   - `chore: maintenance tasks`

2. PR descriptions should include:

   - Clear explanation of changes
   - Any breaking changes
   - Migration steps if needed
   - Related issues/PRs

3. For major releases, maintainers will:
   - Review and organize auto-generated notes
   - Add high-level summaries
   - Document breaking changes
   - Include upgrade guides
