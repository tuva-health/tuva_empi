# Releases

:::caution
Tuva EMPI is in very early stages of development and is changing rapidly. We are not yet at 1.0.0 and so breaking changes can occur in any release. In general, when upgrading, you should not skip versions as deprecated functionality may be removed soon after it's deprecated. Please read the release notes for each release carefully.
:::

The latest releases of Tuva EMPI can be found on our [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva_empi/releases).

Each release includes:

- Version number
- Release notes
- Downloadable assets
- Changelog
