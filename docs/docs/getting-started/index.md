# Getting started

To get started with installing and using Tuva EMPI, you have a couple options.

## Development environment

If you'd like to simply evaluate Tuva EMPI in a local environment, see [README.md](https://github.com/tuva-health/tuva_empi).

## Production environment

Otherwise, if you are looking for guidance on how to deploy Tuva EMPI in a production environment, see [Production Environment](./production-environment).
