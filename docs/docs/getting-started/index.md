# Getting started

To get started with installing and using Tuva EMPI, you have a couple options.

## Local demo environment

If you'd like to simply evaluate Tuva EMPI in a local environment, see [Local demo environment](./local-demo-environment.md).

## Production environment

Otherwise, if you are looking for guidance on how to deploy Tuva EMPI in a production environment, see [Production environment](./production-environment).
